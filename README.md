# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Finger Counting App Repository!

## Overview
This project implements a Finger Counter using OpenCV and MediaPipe libraries. With this application, users can count the number of fingers shown in front of a webcam. It utilizes hand tracking and finger counting techniques to accurately identify and count the number of fingers displayed.

## Features
- **Hand tracking:** Utilizes the MediaPipe library to detect and track hand movements in real-time.
- **Finger counting:** Counts the number of fingers shown in the region of interest.
- **User-friendly interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for easy interaction.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy
